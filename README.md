# Electric Car Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Electric Car Sales Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global electric vehicle (EV) sales data, focusing on market trends, adoption patterns, and environmental impact metrics. Our analysis combines robust data processing with clear visualizations to derive meaningful insights about the EV market's evolution.

## About This Project

This project systematically analyzes electric vehicle market dynamics through three key dimensions:

1. **Vehicle Numbers**: Tracking EV sales and stock quantities
2. **Market Share Metrics**: Analyzing EV sales share and stock share
3. **Environmental Impact**: Measuring electricity demand and oil displacement

Our analysis combines statistical methods with data visualization to uncover patterns and trends in the global EV market.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is hosted on Data.World, which includes detailed records of electric car sales. You can access the dataset through the following link:
