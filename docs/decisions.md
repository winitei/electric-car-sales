# Analysis Decisions Log

## Data Organization Decisions

### 1. Grouping Parameters (March 19, 2025)
**Decision**: Group data into three main categories
- Vehicle Numbers
- Market Share Metrics
- Environmental Impact

**Reasoning**:
- Makes analysis more manageable and logical
- Helps focus on specific aspects of EV adoption
- Enables clearer storytelling through data

**Teaching Notes**:
- This grouping follows industry standard practices
- Makes it easier to understand relationships between related metrics
- Allows for focused analysis of each aspect of EV adoption

### 2. Visualization Approach (March 19, 2025)
**Decision**: Use bar charts with data labels for initial sales trend analysis

**Reasoning**:
- Bar charts effectively show discrete yearly changes
- Data labels provide immediate access to exact values
- Clear visualization helps in quick pattern recognition

**Teaching Notes**:
- Bar charts are ideal for time-series data with discrete intervals
- Adding data labels eliminates need for precise grid reading
- Consistent formatting helps in year-over-year comparisons

## Future Decision Points

### 1. Regional Analysis
**Questions to Consider**:
- How to segment regional data effectively?
- Which regions should we prioritize?
- What visualization methods best show regional comparisons?

### 2. Environmental Impact Analysis
**Questions to Consider**:
- How to effectively correlate EV adoption with environmental metrics?
- What additional data might we need?
- How to present complex environmental relationships clearly?
