# Analysis Methodology

## Data Processing Approach

### 1. Data Organization
We've organized our analysis around three key dimensions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the EV market:

#### Vehicle Numbers
- **EV Sales**: Raw number of electric vehicles sold
- **EV Stock**: Total number of EVs in circulation
- **Rationale**: These metrics provide direct insight into market size and growth

#### Market Share Metrics
- **EV Sales Share**: Percentage of total vehicle sales that are EVs
- **EV Stock Share**: Percentage of total vehicle stock that are EVs
- **Rationale**: These metrics help understand EV market penetration relative to traditional vehicles

#### Environmental Impact
- **Electricity Demand**: Power consumption by EV fleet
- **Oil Displacement**: Reduction in oil consumption
- **Rationale**: These metrics quantify environmental benefits of EV adoption

### 2. Data Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Using pandas to read and process CSV data
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived metrics where needed
4. **Visualization**: Using matplotlib for clear, informative plots

## Current Implementation Details

### Visualization Choices
- **Bar Charts**: Used for yearly trends
  - Rationale: Effective for showing discrete time periods
  - Enhancement: Added data labels for precise value reading

### Code Structure
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis
- Modular code organization by analysis type
- Clear documentation within code cells

## Future Enhancements
- Regional comparison analysis
- Correlation studies between different metrics
- Advanced statistical modeling
